# Homework-Dmytro

### There I made 5 tasks:

- *Finding the longest word in a sentence*

- *Deleting dublicates in an array*

- *Summation the squares of numbers in an array*

- *Comparing the arrays*

- *Making from multidimensional array in one-dimensional array*

## Finding the longest word

### There I:
- *have splitted the sentence with a space*
- *have made the array with the length of each word*
- *found max value of the array*
- *found word which had max length*

## Deleting dublicates
### There I:
- *Used reduce method*
- *Created new array with symbols. If symbols repeat, array is still the same*

## The sum of squares of the numbers
### There I:
- *Used reduce method to add value to previous sum*
- *If index is 1, the code make previous and current number to second degree*

## Comparing of the symbols
### There I:
- *Check if the length of arrays are different, the arrays will different too*
- *Check each symbol is the same as the symbols with same index in another array*

## From multi- to one-dimensional array
### There I:
- *Used method flat with the <code>Infinity</code> argument*
